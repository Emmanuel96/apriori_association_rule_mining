# Association Rule Mining With Student Dataset

**Aim:** The aim here is to demonstrate one application of Association Rule mining with the Apriori Algorithm.

## Project Description

Association rule mining is a very important supervised machine learning method. It's used to find the relationships between different features and this in turn can be used to set association rules. An example application of association rule would be Amazon's suggestion system.

In the simplest form Amazon makes use of their users baskets data to come up with different rules stating what other items a user is likely to buy based on what she/he has already purchased.

In this case, we use the algorithm to find the rules and relationships that exists amongst a student dataset.
